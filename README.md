🧠 Hypothesis-Gate

Hypothesis-Gate is a full-stack web application designed to manage academic research ideas through a structured and secure digital workflow. The platform enables students to submit research ideas, mentors to review and evaluate them, and administrators to manage users and assignments efficiently.

🎯 Project Purpose

In many academic environments, research ideas are shared through informal methods such as emails or documents, leading to poor tracking, lack of transparency, and inefficient evaluation.
